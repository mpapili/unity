**UNITY 3D INTERFACE OVERVIEW**
tips and tricks for the editor! Definitely save this!

Most developers will end up changing the layout overtime
	Window -> layout
		some preconfigured layouts for yourself
		this course will leave it on the default

GAME
	--> tab that shows what actually happens in the game

Asset Store
	--> store where you can buy literally anything, effects, assets, textures, etc

GameObject
	--> this tab up top lets you create things that qualify as game objects. Create a cube from this menu. You can move it through the same 3d arrows as blender.

Main Camera
	--> camera is going to be there from the start. When selected you get a camera preview in the bottomn right. Move it and focus on this preview to get it just as you want. It moves the same way as normal gameobjects otherwise
	--> must have "camera" component checked off!

ROTATE
	Press "E" to enter rotate mode. You can rotate amongst three axises. The outmost will rotate the entire object according to where your camera is.
	This can also be used on the camera itself.

SCALE
	scale size change across any axis by using the "R" key! This enters scale mode!

Select/Move Mode:
	Press "R" to enter the select/move mode

Mesh Renderer
	--> renders the "mesh" which is what the player actually sees
	--> if unchecked the player cannot see the object!

GameObjects
	--> have components
	--> have scripts that can be dragged onto them when you write code

MANUALLY SELECT MODE:
	to select mode (rotate, scale, camera, etc) in the top-left you'll see icons that look like sizing, a hand grabbing something, a cross, etc. Use these to change if keyboard shortcuts do not work.

Your assignment for this one will be to play around, add objects, cameras, scripts, etc. Don't make a game just play.
