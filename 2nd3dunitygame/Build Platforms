**Build Platforms**
	Right now we've been working entirely in PC/web format.
		let's change it to be a MOBILE game!


File --> build settings --> click iOS and click "open download page"
	--> install from package that it downloads
		--> it looks like ours might already be there! We have all packages except for some proprietary consoles (xbox, wii, etc)
	--> let's start off on ios
		--> if you work on windows you won't be able to export with xcode :-/ so start with android instead
		--> select "android" and click "switch platform"
			--> if you go down to your game you can now change your aspect ratio between several popular devices!
			--> the switch itself will take a minute, changing some textures.

In the fantasy demon cave folder let's find the bone bridge
	--> place it dead-center (reset position to 0,0,0 and adjust accordingly for camera
	--> change it around.
	--> we're going to have the bridge "moving"
		--> pull it so there's visible lava between it and the background
