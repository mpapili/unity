**MOVING OBJECTS IN UNITY 3D**

We're going to use a SCRIPT to get our combined-object platform moving!

Prior to writing this script we should put the object into a PREFAB
	--> a prefab is a reusable object that you can instantiate or use/duplicate
		--> you can bundle it and drag+drop it anytime
			--> making your own presets

in assets create a new folder and call it "prefabs"
	--> take your full platform combined-object and drag it into prefabs
		--> nice! you have a preset you made for yourself :)
	--> any changes you make will be applied too ALL the objects made from that prefab
		--> pretty cool

now for scripts!
	--> create a scripts folder under assets
		--> in this folder create a script called "object" for a moveable object
			--> double click it and get it open in MONODEV! (WOOHOO)

sooo we want to make this look like infinitely looping ground. We won't actually use infinite ground as that would kill memory.
	we definitely want to use "Update{}" to do this for our object script! It updates every frame (yes, videogame frame!)
		--> all games generally will use this

So how do we get this combined-object moving? Well select it in unity. It has a component called "transform" which declares its position
	--> we can access this in C# via code!


**TIME.DELTATIME FRAMERATE INDEPENDENT**
Add this into the update function of our object script:

			transform.Translate(Vector3.left * (20 * Time.deltaTime));

	this can access the "transform" component (make sure its lowercase) of any game object it's attached to and manipulate the number (.Translate) via the args given.
	Vector3.left is another part of unity. It says we're moving this vector (transform component is a vector) TO THE LEFT.
	20 is just a guess we can change this
	Time.deltaTime
		--> computers have different framerates. We can't use frames for EVERYTHING as the framerate for an iphone4 vs an iphoneX would be a totally different game!
			--> Time.deltaTime will make them move at the same speed and framerate only controls slowness.
				--> this is usually excluded in CONSOLE development. Interestinggg.
				--> Time.deltaTime is the TIME between this frame and the LAST frame. Woah HUGELY important

**SELF-TAUGHT**
	--> we made ours at a weird angle so we'll need to use ".right" instead of ".left" !
	--> instructor calls his class + script "Object" and "Objects" these are overloaded and causes tons of errors!
		--> make it something obscure like "objectsScript" and MAKE SURE THE CLASS NAME IS CHANGED TOO!

Drag the script from assets (after saving) to the combined object of the platform. Save everything and "run"
	--> you should see the platform fly humorously fast to the side. THIS IS GOOD.


**SERIALIZED FIELD**

Let's make a private variable that the inspector in unity can see with [SerializedField] and have THAT variable be what used to be our hardcoded "20" for speed.


using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class objectsScript : MonoBehaviour {

	//Makes a private variable that the "inspector" in unity can see
	[SerializeField] float objectSpeed = 1;

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {

	}

	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		//ACCESS ASSIGNED OBJECT'S TRANSFORM COMPONENT
		//MOVE LEFT 20 * [time since last frame]
		transform.Translate(Vector3.right * (objectSpeed * Time.deltaTime));
	}
}


THIS IS AWESOME! Not only is it moving at a great speed BUT you can change the value of this PRIVATE INT from the INSPECTOR in unity!
	--> you can do this even while the game is running! WHATTTT!
		--> [SerializedField] is HUGELY Important!
			--> we switched it to "4" which seemed nice DURING GAMEPLAY. Amazing.
