**ANIMATING AND IMPORTING CHARACTER MODELS**
	--> very important to know!
	--> this course will use assets provided for the course by bitgem (we have a 15% coupon remember)

Let's find our assets. We're going to use the "zombie"
	--> we'll need the textures and animations.

Create a folder under assets in your unity project, let's call it zombie.
	--> drag the models and textures folder into that zombies folder
		--> zombierushassets --> 3d --> zombie
			--> this will take a few minutes. HAVING A GOOD SSD IS NECESSARY FOR THIS.

check it out. you have two zombies. micro_zombie and micro_zombie_mobile. Not bad. Let's check it out.
	--> model has basic information
		--> rig has info for the skeletons and models
			--> you should use BLENDER
		--> animations
			--> frames that have been set on the rig+mesh!

**animating**
	--> in animations (with your model selected) let's make an idle animation
		--> start is gonna be "6" end is gonna be "65"
			--> these are frames
			--> check out the "animation list" for these
				--> 395-399 (frames!)
				--> animations lists are like movies. you can say when your animation starts and stops and name it 
				--> notice that idle is 6 to 65
				--> make a new one called "jump" 
					--> in the list we see jump animation is from 395-399
	--> you can play these animations in the preview
	--> GET GOOD WITH RENDER


Sweet we have two animations we can use. Let's save project, then drag and drop our mobile zombie onto the scene!
	--> add him in and expand him in the heiarchy. oh cool his name is brian(?) REMEMBER THAT.
		--> change his shader (oops you can't for some reason)
			--> place him, rotate him, scale him.

Play the game. Okay he's cool but WE NEED AN "ANIMATION CONTROLLER"

MAKE A NEW FOLDER IN "ASSETS" called "animations"
	--> create
		--> animation controller
			--> drag your new animation controller onto the animation controller component of the zombie object (woahh)
			--> from the ".fbx" file it added the animation component for us because it detected that it was animated!


DOUBLE-CLICK THE ANIMATION CONTROLLER TO OPEN THE ANIMATOR TAB (WHAT)
	--> we have some layers but nothing else
		--> we need to import the animation clips we made on our object earlier!

	--> (hold down mouse wheel to move around here!)
	--> we can access these settings we made earlier
		--> assets, models, zombie (CLICK THE RIGHT ARROW TO EXPAND THE MICRO_ZOMBIE OBJECT)
			--> woah! our clips are here!
	
			--> drag the idle clip into the animator window
				--> entry will tie to the DEFAULT ANIMATION (idle)
			--> "jump" will not be tied to anything at this time (fine)

	--> when he jumps we want to make a TRANSITION FROM jump
		--> right click "jump" and select "create transition"
			--> drag it to "idle"
				--> this means after jump it'll transition back into idle


Time to make some JUMP CODEEEE!

In the scripts folder make a "player" script!
	--> name the zombie object "player"


HERE'S THE CODE:


using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour {

	//create an animator object --> searches animator object 
	Animator anim;

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
		//will search object script is assigned-to for an animator component (our zombie player has one!)
		anim = GetComponent<Animator> ();

	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {

		//let's capture the input of a mouse-click or tap
		if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown (0)) {		//"0" means left-click!
			anim.Play("jump");	//will play the jump animation
		}

	}
}



Drag the script onto the PLAYER object (the highest one up, not "brian" or anything) and let it rip! IT WORKS!
	--> a small side-course for animating skeletons in blender would be solid
