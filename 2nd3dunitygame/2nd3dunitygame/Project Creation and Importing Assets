**Project Creation and Importing Assets**

Create a fresh project in unity.

At this point devslopes is rearranging his layout so that he can see the "game" and "scene in the same window. You can do this if you want with layout 2-by-3 but whatever.

*Save scene, save project, and continue.*

At this point we download the assets files from the course program.

We're getting rid of all of the "obj" files and "max" files.
	We need "textures" and "FBX" files

From your file manager drag the entire folder once it's thinned out (Fantasy Demon Cave) into the project tab in "assets".
	--> this can take up to 45 minutes to import! It's totally normal and has always been the way it's been.
	--> confirmed. This is taking a while -_-
	--> ended up only taking like 3-4 minutes, looks like SSD's win the day. Unity should be done on a computer with a nice plextor drive I bet.

After it's imported check out what it offers. Look at those demos. The demos show you some posibilities of what you can do with just this asset pack!

Import and try it out!

Don't worry, you're just learning the ins and outs of the unity-editor and how to handle some of these things now. It's still very important. We'll learn more of the 'doing' part next time.
