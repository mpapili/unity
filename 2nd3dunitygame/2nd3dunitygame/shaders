**Shaders**
We now want to get the lighting better set up AND the materials better set up

So click a big object. You'll notice under components there is MESH RENDERER

Shader Component:
	--> shiny difuse shader made by default
		--> let's play with these built-in shaders to see if we can make this look right
			--> try unlit --> texture
				--> adjust the directional lighting woah
					--> object is immune to lighting!
			--> there's "mobile" which is mobile-supported(?)
			--> keep it unlit until you can figure out what you want to do with it
			--> transparent difuse is sweet

turn off the directional light now.
	--> lava looks terrible! Let's make it unlit so that removing the directional light doesn't ruin it

Change the background that the main camera sees:
	--> main camera
		--> camera component
			--> background --> black

Black isn't a great background though, let's make GIANT mountains
	CMD+D on a mountain, drag it to the back, and make it huuuuge ("R" to scale)
		do this on both sides
			--> universal scale in scale mode is the yellow cube in the middle
				--> scales all three directions equally, useful!

This video we've changed shaders on individual materials
	we've removed lighting which is what you NORMALLY WILL DO for hand-painted textures!
		--> they often have their own shadows on them already
		--> making things immune to the directional light keeps its original style
