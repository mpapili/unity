**EXTENDING THIS GAME**

a few things for a project!

make sure the player dies if they hit the ground!

create a game over screen!
	- assets included

Collect "coins" and a score!
	--> coin texture is in there actually
		--> "portal" texture
		--> detect a colision, collect the coin


the last thing? Let's slowly rotate those rocks so they look better!
	--> you have everything! take your skils to the next level on your own
