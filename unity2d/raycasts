**Raycasts, tags, and placing the towers**
So we can changed the selectedTower gameobject and we want to be able to CLICK on the game scene and create a tower there!

open up tower manager

we need to know when the mouse clicks, where it clicks, and know exactly where to place our tower objects. We'll be using RAYCASTS for this.

RAYCAST --> variable where you can find where you clicked. Closest build-tile that you can place the object on
		--> an invisible line from where you click shooting to the scene and will tell you as soon as it intersects with something
			--> pretend clicking or touching creates an invisible line that shoots into the scene


	public void placeTower(RaycastHit2D hit) {
		//create the tower
		GameObject newTower = Instantiate(towerBtnPressed.TowerObject);
		//set newTower transform position to equal the raycast's transform position
		newTower.transform.position = hit.transform.position;
	}


and


	void Update () {
		// "0" is left "1" is right
		if (Input.GetMouseButton (0)) {
			//get world point from PERSPECTIVE of the camera!
			Vector2 worldPoint = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
			//notice Input.mousePosition!
			RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Raycast(worldPoint, Vector2.zero);

			placeTower (hit);
		}
	}


uh oh! for raycasts the buttons are above EVERYTHING.
	--> using UnityEngine.EventSystems;
			// UI isn't a game object
		if (!EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject () && towerBtnPressed != null) {


uh oh again! We can spawn towers buttt there's no game object collider to hit on the ground!


We'll need to do some tagging right now to test colliders!
We need box colliders on ground, path, buildsites!
	--> select all ground objects and add an is triggerd boxcollider2d with it
		--> do the same for buildsites
Tag time!
	--> add a buildSite tag!
	--> add a ground tag!
	--> add a tower tag!
		--> tag everything accordingly!

OMG we can place towers!
	--> let's make sure that you're not hitting a tower or non-build site!
				if (hit.collider.tag == "buildsite") {

easy.
done.

but now we have bad pivots(?) and can place towers on top of towers! (oh no)

select the "front" sprites under towers in assssets
	--> pivot is on center
		--> mess around until you're happy. He uses
			X = 0.26
			Y = 0.5
				--> looks bad, we'll keep it at "center" for our sprites! good to know though!
				--> hmm actually no let's see
					--> castle tower is awful
						--> i like pivot 0.5, 0.25 !
				--> hit apply to apply to the prefabs
					--> actually same for the archer tower! Change that Y-pivot a bit!
					--> castle tower is already perfect

good video! Next up will be projectiles and gamey elements!
