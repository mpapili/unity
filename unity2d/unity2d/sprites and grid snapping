**Sprites and Grid Snapping**

start a new unity project named TowerDefense and name it "2d" - keep unity analytics off

We're going to download the new asset pack (woohoo!)

over in the game scene change the aspet from free to 16:9, you should see it reflected there.
	--> let's drag in the assets which you've already extracted cause you're awesome

drag the models folder right into the assets folder (yay already named)

we also have a plugins folder for visual studio (bleh) we're going to be using mono cause we're hardcore (we aren't)
	--> notice loading this way wayyy faster for some reason. INTERESTING.

we'll actually be turning all of these png's INTO an animation (what!)

unity converts png to sprites in 2d mode right away which is perfect for us

extras --> folder for a finishing details to decorate the level (some nice polishing to make it look more professional)

GUI --> things like buttons, loading bars, elements, we'll get more into it later in the course.

Towers --> several towers for your tower defense game
	--> castles, etc

make a new folder in assets called "sprites"

drag the "Arrow" into sprites!
continue dragging in these assets and folders and drag them all over (except for GUI) at the same time

here the instructor sets up visual studio. We'll be using monospace.

We need to make a new folder for "animations" 
	- create controllers folder
	- create animations folder

We'll see how all of this works later on.

Make a prefabs folder. Like the last project, prefabs are EXTREMELY useful. Always use them if you use an object more than once!

Make a "scripts" folder for all of our code

make a "scenes" folder for multiple levels (ooooh)
	--> save your scene as "level1" (save scene as..)

TIME TO GET GOING. Let's make a map first!

create an empty gameobject called "map1"
	--> this will be the world we create with all child sprites

go to your ground sprites assets and drag some grass onto your map
	--> woah it's huge!
		--> scale globally with "pixels per unit"
			--> we'll be using 300! Play around with other screens :)
				--> change this setting ON THE ASSET ITSELF

Shift-click all of them and make the global change (nice!)

Create another empty object called "ground"

try and add a second block... hmm... it doesn't snap? that'd be insane if we made a grid with no snap settings!

snap settings are in your edit menu
	edit --> snap settings
		--> shrink it down to 0.85 (this will detect and snap edges for ours)


NOW try moving your tiles while holding CTRL ... THEY SNAP!

NICE! now try covering the whole ground in grass.
	--> select multiple, ctrl+d , crtl+drag for snap
		--> rinse and repeat :)

head over to your game. looks perfect, we're good to go with unity2d in unity3d
