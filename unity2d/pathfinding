**Enemy Pathfinding in Unity**
We were working on our game manager code. We've spawned an enemy but we have to attach a script to our enemy prefabs!
	--> we can actually knock out all three at once!

select enemy1, add a script named enemy
	--> move from main asset folder into scripts folder
	--> open visual studio (or monodevelop)

Now, code for the logic will be at the bottom but we have to mind our tags! Also, save your checkpoints array AS A PREFAB because we'll need to assign them all to an array as our enemies move through them.

IT WORKS. The little enemy moves through the path and then dies at the finish!

Now let's spawn the enemies from within the gameManager using an IEnumerator* (amazing)
	--> play with spawning via update. It spawns the enemy limit! buttt it's clunky.
		--> IEnumerator is a coroutine
			--> coroutines have built-in wait functions which is great for unity and C# in-general
			--> have it call itself at the end (over and over) with a return yield statement and call it once initially from start to set the coroutine in motion!

IT WORKS in the game we're spawning waves of enemies slowly every half-second! Code will be underneath.

Be sure to copy and paste the script components to enemy2 and enemy3!
