Installing unity on windows and osx is easy. On linux... ehh....

So I found a nice .deb file from:
https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/

-looks like we're good to do everything EXCEPT test on ios... bummer :-/

**NOTE**

monodevelop was NOT WORKING OUT OF THE BOX so i installed monodevelop-complete with
	sudo apt-get install mono-complete
		others were clearly having this bug as well.

there's a non-deb extraction-based installer but that leaves the dependencies up to you and i couldn't stomach it on arch sooo...

Afterwards launc unity.

Make an account.

Create a project and start up the "standard assets project"

Click to create a new project and name it TestProject
	set as 3D or 2D
	create the project
	fantastic

Make sure it opens a very IDE-looking IDE and you're good to go
