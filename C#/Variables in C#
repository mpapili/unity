C# Variables in Unity 3D

Create a new project in unity. You can do this lesson in any compiler but who cares.

Right click in assets and create a new C# script called "variables"

Remember your scripts need to be dragged onto objects. Let's drag out script onto Main Camera to attach it to the Variable script.

Remember "start" is called when the object is created and the "update" function is called over and over again per the framerate of the game!

To get debug logging, click the console in the section down below and then click "run" to start your game. Your debug trace will show up down here! (nice)

using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Variables : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
		string name = "Thanos";	//thanos is stored as a string in 'name'
								//semicolon ends the statement
		string equippedWeapon = "Infinity Gauntlet";
		string favoriteFurniture = "throne";

		Debug.Log(equippedWeapon);
		Debug.Log(name);
		Debug.Log (favoriteFurniture);
		Debug.Log (equippedWeapon.ToUpper());

	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
	}
}

those Debug.Log's just print stuff to the log. Easy right?
These are just basic strings. Use "." in monodev to see all the functions a string offers, that's how we found the .ToUpper()   :)
