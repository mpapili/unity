**CONDITIONALS**

This douche has activated the paid version of unity so now he gets the cool dark skin -_- anyways...

Conditionals are like in any language. They make decisions. Let's make a brand new C# script called conditionals.

Open your conditionals.cs in monodev and let's get going to make some decisions in C# !

Throw it on the main camera and look at the console in the bottom section to get that sweet sweet debug trace.

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Conditionals : MonoBehaviour {

	int health = -10;
	//bools in C# !
	bool gameOver = false;
	int lives = 3;

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {

		//Conditional example
		if (health <= 0 && lives == 0) {
			gameOver = true;
		}

		//if+else example:
		if (gameOver == true) {
			Debug.Log ("The game is over!");
		} else {
			Debug.Log ("You're still alive buddy!");
		}
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
	}
}


Nice! Great example where we learn booleans, if's, and else's. Also How to have multiple conditions for one conditional with && !!!

Here's a tower-defense game as player1! 

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Conditionals2 : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use this for initialization
	int towersRemainingP1 = 3;
	int towersRemainingP2 = 3;
	bool mainTowerDestroyedP1 = false;
	bool mainTowerDestroyedP2 = false;
	float timer = 200;

	void Start () {

		if (mainTowerDestroyedP1 == true) {
			Debug.Log ("you have lost the game!");
		}

		else if (timer <= 0) {
			//intro to the || "or" statement!
			if (mainTowerDestroyedP1 == true || towersRemainingP1 == 0) {
				Debug.Log ("You have lost the game!");
			}
		}

	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
	}
}


notice that we learn the "or" statement with || here for C#!
Here's some enhanced logic for a two-player find-out-who-wins scenario:

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Conditionals2 : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use this for initialization
	int towersRemainingP1 = 3;
	int towersRemainingP2 = 3;
	bool mainTowerDestroyedP1 = false;
	bool mainTowerDestroyedP2 = false;
	float timer = 200;

	void Start () {
		//like in python you can use booleans without " == true" !!
		if (mainTowerDestroyedP1 || mainTowerDestroyedP2) {

			if (mainTowerDestroyedP1) {
				Debug.Log ("player 1 lost");
			} else if (mainTowerDestroyedP2) {
				Debug.Log ("player 2 lost");
			} else if (timer <= 0) {
				Debug.Log ("time is up");
				if (towersRemainingP1 > towersRemainingP2) {
					Debug.Log ("player 1 wins");
				} else if (towersRemainingP2 > towersRemainingP1) {
					Debug.Log ("player 2 wins");
				} else {
					Debug.Log ("the game was a draw");
				}
			}
		}

		//example of binary operators "==", "||", "!=", "&&"
		//binary operators work on two things, one on the left and one on the right
		if (true == false || false != true && 1 == 1) {
			Debug.Log ("your example was a success!");	//this executes
		}
	}
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		timer -= 20;
	}
}

notice the section on binary operators, very useful.
